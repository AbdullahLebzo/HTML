	<h2>The Journey to the Lake</h2>

	<p>I still remember going fishing with my grandfather <em>early</em> in the morning to the lake. He would wake me up before daylight and we would hop into his old ford truck. The morning <em>breeze</em> would gently wake me by the time we arrived at the lake. Once there, he would secure my life-vest and we would jump into this silver boat and head out to his to his favorite stop. I don't remember the conversations that much, but I always enjoyed it just being the two of us and catching the <strong>fish</strong>.</p>

	<h2>The Cooking</h2>

	<p>No matter what we caught, large or smallmy grandmother would clean it, season it and have it fried by lunch time. I wish I had asked her about recipes then, but hindsight is always <strong>20/20</strong>. This is why I figured I would merge my new programming skills and create a recipe using HTML lists.</p>
